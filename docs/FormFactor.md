# SynthBloks Form Factor
Aside from their shape, Synthbloks are based on the Eurorack standard for modular synthesizers, with some minor changes.

## Physical Specifications
- Mostly cube-shaped
- Integrated power rails
- Grid-like, stackable design
- Technical details coming soon

## Power Rails
- Each module is powered via the pin headers on its sides, which are also used to supply power to other modules.
- Each pin header set consists of six male and six female pins
- Each 6-pin header includes 12v, -12v, 5v, and GND rails
- Connector pinout coming soon
Module power consumption is not yet standardized.

### CVs, Inputs, and Outputs
Synthbloks use 3.5mm TS jacks for all external connections. Incoming and outgoing signals should be -5v to +5v, and oscillator modules are recommended to use 1v/oct standard.
