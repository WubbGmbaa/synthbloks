# SynthBloks
SynthBloks are modular synthesizer modules in a fun form factor.

### Roadmap
Until the first release of this form factor, the standards described here are subject to change, as issues are fixed and features are added. As part of the process involved in designing and testing the form factor, modules will be designed based on pre-existing, open-source circuits. These modules will also serve a secondary purpose as a "proof of concept" to demonstrate the format, and are hosted in the [synthbloks-PoC repository](https://github.com/WubbGmbaa/synthbloks_POC). Once these "proof of concept" modules have been used to test and change the SynthBloks standard form factor, the first release of the form factor (this repository) will be made. After the first official release of the standards described here, modules will be developed from original circuits, and hosted in their own repositories.

### Development
This repository contains documentation about the standard, as well as resources for desiging modules. Technical details about the form factor can be found [within the documentation](../docs/FormFactor.md).
Proof-of-concept modules were previously also held here, but have since been moved to [their own repository](https://github.com/WubbGmbaa/synthbloks_POC).
