# SynthBloks
SynthBloks are modular synthesizer modules in a fun form factor.

First-party modules can be found under [bloks](../bloks).
Technical details about the form factor (which is also called "SynthBloks") can be found [within the documentation](../docs/FormFactor.md).
A non-comprehensive list of third-party modules will be added to the documentation as needed. Submit a pull request to add modules to the list.
