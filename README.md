# SynthBloks
SynthBloks are modular synthesizer modules in a fun form factor.

First-party modules can be found under [bloks](../bloks).
Technical details about the form factor (which is also called "SynthBloks") can be found [within the documentation](../docs/FormFactor.md).
A non-comprehensive list of third-party modules will be added to the documentation as needed. Modules can be added to this list by [reporting an issue](https://github.com/wubbgmbaa/synthbloks/issues/new). (A more appropriate form will be developed eventually)

### Development
You can follow the development of this project, among many others, on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wubb_gmbaa).
